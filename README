Prime Generating Polynomials 

Across multiple gp runs, similar error values continue to emerge which prevent progress. To identify the values, take the push program produced and run it in inter.ss. The values will be in reverse order from the errors in the gp run. Thus, if an error is 9 values from the end, then the value from inter.ss is 9 values from the beginning [of the sequence]. 

Values such as: 

Error  	    Values	Product of Primes 
10/41	    1681 	41,41
830/1763    1763	41,43
890/2021    2021 	43,47

These values are products of primes. They are also the consecutive non-prime values on an ulam spiral starting at 41. [http://www.algorithm.co.il/blogs/index.php/tag/ulam-spiral/] 

Possibilities moving forward / modifications: 

      - research products of primes 
      	- effect on totient values 
	- heuristic for fitness function (modification) 
	- figure out fix 
	  - regression to sequence of primes? 
	  - make multivariable? 
	  - prime or uniquely expressible by prime factors produced by another polynomial
	    	  http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath058.htm
		  - evolve second polynomial?
	  - proximate prime polynomials?

		      http://www.naturalnumbers.org/highpolys.html
		      http://www.naturalnumbers.org/polyalignment.html
		      - percentage of primes included in fitness function 
		      - distinct primes 
		      - sections of ordered primes
	  - evolve prime-poly of form L(n)=an+b (Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions)
	  - evolve higher prime generating polynomials based on Green-Tao theorem 
	    - for any k there exists a pair of a and b with the property that L(n) = an + b is prime for any n from 0 to k-1. 
	      - best known result of such type is for k = 26 
	  -Term stack 
	       term 1: 3x^2
	       term 2: -5x 
	       term 3: +4 

	       each term on the stack has the following attributes:
	       	    sign (+/-)
		    coefficient 
		    variable (x) {constant for single variable}
		    exponent (integer n, where n occurs as x^n)

	   - prime generating power series? 
	   - Lagrange polynomial on multiple gp run results or preexisting prime generating polynomials? 
	   - It is not known whether there exists a univariate polynomial of degree at least 2 that assumes an infinite number of values that are prime.

1947 H. Mills proved that there exists a real number A, for which A^3^n is always prime for an arbitrary positive integer n.

something random

General outline for presentation: 

- initial generations 

  	  - generating for values less than range 41
	    - return good functions completely prime 

- increase range to 50 

  	   - gp's failing 

	     - similar errors 

	       - translated error values into regular values, 

	       	 	    similar values occuring across runs 

			    values are products of primes > 41 

			    all values are on downward diagonal of ulam spiral beginning at 41 

			    [ explain why prime polynomial cannot generate only primes ] 

			    [ explain ulam spiral ] (why originally began at 41?)
